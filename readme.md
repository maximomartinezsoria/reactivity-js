# JavaScript Reactivity System
Allow us to automatically recalculate a value based in another.

## Approaches
Take a look at the tags so you can see two different ways to accomplish our goal.

## How to use it
1. Clone repo.
2. Get into node.
```
$ node
```
3. Load the file.
```
$ .load index.js
```
4. Play with default values or create yours modifing the `data` object and adding the reactive property into the `watcher` callback.
